# Parallelism Vs Concurrency
Parallelism is when multiple tasks run at the same time on multiple processors or CPU
cores; concurrency is when multiple tasks take turns running on a single CPU core. When
a restaurant has a single person alternately taking orders and clearing tables, that’s
concurrency. But a restaurant that has one person taking orders and a different person
clearing tables, that’s parallelism.
